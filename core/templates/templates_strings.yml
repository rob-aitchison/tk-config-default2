# The strings section is similar to the paths section - but rather than defining paths
# on disk, it contains a list of strings. Strings are typically used when you want to be
# able to configure the way data is written to shotgun - it may be the name field for a
# review version or the formatting of a publish.
#

strings:

    # when a review Version in Shotgun is created inside of Nuke, this is the
    # name that is being given to it (the code field)
    nuke_shot_version_name: "{Shot}_{name}_{nuke.output}_v{version}.{iteration}"
    nuke_quick_shot_version_name: "{Shot}_{name}_quick_{iteration}"

    nuke_asset_version_name: "{Asset}_{name}_{nuke.output}_v{version}.{iteration}"
    nuke_quick_asset_version_name: "{Asset}_{name}_quick_{iteration}"

    # defines how the {tk_version} token in Hiero gets formatted back to tk.
    hiero_version: "{version}"

    # define how new Mari projects should be named
    mari_asset_project_name: "{mari.project_name} - Asset {asset_name}, {task_name}"
